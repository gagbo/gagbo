# Gerry Agbobada

I'm a backend software engineer, and this is my github profile. I mostly like Rust and Schemes, but I'm currently 
enjoying Scala and I have good experience in C++ as well, trying to embed the languages I like working with inside
the ones I like hacking with.

Sometimes, I [blog](https://gagbo.net). It is quite rare though.

I mostly use my github profile for work, and to contribute to Emacs ecosystem through
[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) or packages like [consult-lsp](https://github.com/gagbo/consult-lsp).

I think my most fun projects are:
- [Xile](https://github.com/gagbo/xile): draft of a front-end for
  [Xi editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), written in Guile Scheme, and
- [R7.rs](https://git.sr.ht/~gagbo/rseven): a Rust hosted R7RS scheme (WIP, and interpreter only for now)
- [tree-sitter-org](https://github.com/gagbo/tree-sitter-org): a tentative to make a tree-sitter grammar
  for org-mode syntax.
