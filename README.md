# Gerry Agbobada

I'm a backend software engineer, and this is my github
profile. I mostly like Rust
and Schemes, but I have good experience in C++ and Python as well, trying to
embed the languages I like working with inside the ones I like hacking with. That
makes Rust and Web Assembly really nice technologies to explore!

Sometimes, I [blog](https://gagbo.net). It is quite rare though.

Nowadays I mostly use my github profile to contribute to Emacs ecosystem through
[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) or packages like
[consult-lsp](https://github.com/gagbo/consult-lsp) and [a converter from org to
tree-sitter test](https://github.com/gagbo/org-to-tree-sitter-corpus).

I think my most fun projects are:
- [Xile](https://github.com/gagbo/xile): draft of a front-end for
  [Xi editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), written in Guile Scheme
- [R7.rs](https://gitlab.com/gagbo/rseven): a Rust hosted R7RS scheme (WIP, and interpreter only for now)
- [tree-sitter-org](https://github.com/gagbo/tree-sitter-org): a tentative to make a tree-sitter grammar
  for org-mode syntax. Currently it's in a "waiting" state until org grammar is a little clarified
  
I am also getting my feet wet with front-development with [my fork](https://gitlab.com/gagbo/rustpad) of
[Rustpad](https://github.com/ekzhang/rustpad) which adds integration with
[Piston](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston) for shared remote code execution. It is currently hosted
live on [pad.gagbo.net](httlab.coma.gagbo.net).
